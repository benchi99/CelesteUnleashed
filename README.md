## Building the project locally

You may require to set up Visual Studio with the [components required](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/445236692136230943/698269484653215844/celeste.vsconfig) for developing Celeste mods with Everest, as well as [setting up the project](https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Your-First-Code-Mod#project-setup) accordingly for building.

This project is missing the FMOD bank built from the Celeste FMOD project, as well as the sound effects; both things not being my property at all, and thus being excluded from this GIT repository.

I mean do you _really_ want to contribute to this? Up to you, though, shoot a PR if you want.
